# DeFi Crypto Portfolio Management System

Welcome to the **DeFi Crypto Portfolio Management System** repository! This project provides a modular and extensible architecture for managing cryptocurrency portfolios using **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** protocols. The system leverages **Oracle models**, a **Portfolio Manager**, and **DEX (Decentralized Exchange) interfaces** to automate and optimize portfolio rebalancing based on predictive analytics.

## üõ† System Overview

The system is built around three primary components:

1. **Oracle Interface**  
   Computes optimal portfolio weights based on real-time market data and predictive models (e.g., Numerai meta-model).  
   **Key Functions**:
   - Fetch portfolio weights (`fetch_portfolio_weights`)
   - Validate portfolio weights (`validate_weights`)

2. **Portfolio Manager**  
   Acts as the central coordinator, interfacing with the Oracle for weights and the DEX for execution.  
   **Key Function**:
   - Manage portfolio (`manage_portfolio`) by fetching and validating weights, then executing trades.

3. **DEX Interface**  
   Facilitates interaction with decentralized exchanges, including fetching tradable assets and setting portfolio weights.  
   **Key Functions**:
   - Retrieve the tradable asset universe (`get_universe`)
   - Execute portfolio rebalancing (`set_portfolio_weights`)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/defi-crypto-portfolio.git
   cd defi-crypto-portfolio
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if applicable):
  ```bash
  Copy code
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
3. Configure the system:
   Rename hyperliquid_config_template.json to hyperliquid_config.json and enter your API credentials for HyperLiquid.

4. Run the example notebook (in testnet!):

## üìà Future Enhancements
Implement concrete Oracle and DEX classes for integration with live data sources.
Extend the Portfolio Manager to include risk management and performance analytics.
Build additional DEX integrations to support more trading platforms.
